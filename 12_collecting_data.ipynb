    "    - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)\n",

    "    \n",
    "- Many organizations/sites offers data in processed form. For example, IMDB. You can download a subset of IMDB database from [here](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/).\n",
    "- Many colleges and universites publish the data that they used for research. Anyone can download the data for education purpose.\n",
    "- And finally, you can also download your personal data from sites like netflix, google, etc. You can perform analysis on your personal data. How cool is that!\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the datasets are in **CSV** or **TSV format**. You can download them by following the instructions mentioned in the respective sites. And then, you can read them using pandas. \n",

    "Long story short, there are many resources for downloading datasets. You don't have to worry about building your own dataset. Finally, here is a great repository to find a lot more datasets. Its called [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)."
